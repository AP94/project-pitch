# Project Title (replace me)

## Overview
_What's this project about, briefly?_


## The user and a language
This section describes who the project would serve and why a language might be a
good way to meet their needs.


### What's the need?
_What need is met by your idea? Who are you helping? What is that person's
experience like now? What would their experience be like if you could help 
them?_


### Why a language?
_Why is a DSL appropriate for your user(s)? How does it address the need?_


### Why you?
_What excites you about this idea? How did you come up with it?_


### Interface (syntax)
_How might the user interact with the language? What does programming look 
like? Why is this the right way to interact with the problem domain? Be careful
to distinguish between, e.g,. a graphical interface and a linguistic interface._ 


### Operation (semantics)
_What might happen when a program runs? How does a program interact with the
user? What kinds of semantic (i.e., non-syntax) errors might occur, and how 
might they be communicated to the user?_


### Expressiveness
_What should be easy to do in this language? What should be possible, but
difficult? What should be impossible or very difficult?_


### Related work
_Are there any other DSLs in this domain? If not, describe how you know there
aren't and conjecture why not. If so, describe them and provide links. How well 
do they address the need? Are there any particularly admirable qualities of the
language? Are there parts of the language you think could be improved?_


## The Project
This section examines whether the idea makes for a good CS 111 project.


### Suitability
_What percentage of your time do you think will be spent directly engaging in
the **language** aspects of this project (e.g., making language design
decisions), as opposed to "systems" aspects of the project (e.g., implementing a
complicated semantics that doesn't require a lot of language design)?_


### Scope
_How big an idea is this? How ambitious is this project?_


### Challenges and opportunities
_Why is this a good project? What are some challenges you expect to face? How
might you overcome them? What are some warning signs that the project has gotten
off track, and how will you get the project back on track if needed?_
